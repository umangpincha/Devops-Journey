## Day 2
> To change permission : chmod 500 filename
> To create group : groupadd groupname
> To create user : useradd -m username
> To add user in group : gpasswd -a username groupname  [here -a flag is to add]
> To check users in which file ? -> /etc/passwd
> To check groups in which file ? -> /etc/group
> To change groupname of a file -> chgrp groupname filename 
  (Eg: chgrp tapusena boom.txt) so now boom.txt groupname will be tapusena instead of ubuntu and all users in tapusena group will have the permission which boom.txt has for its groupmemebers.
> scp -i "file.pem" source dest
